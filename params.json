{"name":"tonic.js","tagline":"Event based job pipeline","body":"tonic.js\r\n=======\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmrudick/tonic.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tmrudick/tonic)\r\n\r\ntonic helps to build scheduled or event based job pipelines using JavaScript. It can be used to build a system of triggers similar to IFTTT but with more complex logic utilizing any data source and boolean operations.\r\n\r\nImagine you wanted to text youself whenever your favorite football team scored a touchdown. You could write a series of functions which: poll a sports API every 30 seconds and if there is a change in the score reformat the response from the API and then send a text message to your phone number. tonic allows you to write such a complex system of functions in a modular and reusable way.\r\n\r\nExample Uses\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Data driven websites\r\n\r\nBoth [tomrudick.com](http://tomrudick.com), [api.tomrudick.com](http://api.tomrudick.com), and [ellenchisa.com](http://ellenchisa.com) use tonic to display near-real-time data that is automatically updated.\r\n\r\n### Home automation\r\n\r\nThe [hue-weather-lights](https://github.com/tmrudick/hue-weather-lights) project uses tonic to change the colors of Philips Hue lightbulbs based on local weather conditions.\r\n\r\nHave another use?\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBefore you get started, you must already have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed.\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\n    $ npm install -g tonic\r\n\r\n### Creating an Empty Project\r\n\r\n    $ tonic new TonicProject\r\n    $ cd TonicProject ; npm install\r\n\r\nThis will create and setup empty project ready for you to start creating jobs.\r\n\r\n### Writing a Job\r\n\r\nCreate a new file in the jobs directory with a .js extension.\r\n\r\n    job('EveryMinute', function() {\r\n      console.log('Running...');\r\n    }).every('1min');\r\n\r\nThis will create a new job that executes once every minute.\r\n\r\n### Running\r\n\r\n    $ node app.js\r\n\r\nThis will run all registered jobs. You should see `Running...` printed out to the console once every minute.\r\n\r\n### Chaining Jobs\r\n\r\nCreate another file in the jobs directory with a .js extension.\r\n\r\n    job('RandomGenerator', function(done) {\r\n      var rnd = Math.random();\r\n\r\n      done(rnd);\r\n    }).every('10 seconds');\r\n\r\n    job('RandomPrinter', function(done, rnd) {\r\n      console.log('Random:', rnd);\r\n    }).after('RandomGenerator');\r\n\r\nYou can rerun `app.js` and you should now see a random number printed to the console every 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nIn this example, RandomGenerator will run every second and RandomPrinter will be run after RandomGenerator completes. The done callback is used to denote that a job has completely successfully. If there are no dependent jobs, calling done is optional.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nCheck out the entire [documentation](http://tonicjs.org/docs) for more information.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
